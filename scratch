## Does a team being the manufacturer of their engine affect performance?
- [x] Need to collect data for a subset of years and teams.
    Collected the data from the sources pointed to by `extra-data-sources.txt`.

- [x] Need to preprocess the data to play well with our existing data.
    Needed to change some team names to match the current dataset.

    ```
    Hass        -> Haas F1 Team
    Manor       -> Manor Marussia
    Alpha Tauri -> AlphaTauri
    Red bull    -> Red Bull
    ```

    Then I replaced the team name by the constructor Id.

- [x] Some teams changed their neames between 2010-2020
    ```
    Force India -> Racing Point,
    Toro Rosso  -> AlphaTauri,
    Sauber      -> Alfa Romeo,
    Lotus       -> Renault,
    Marussia    -> Manor Marussia
    ```

- [x] Average performance per team (5 years is too much since the data I collected is only 2010-2020).
    This can be computed from the `constructor_standings` table which contains the points accumulated by each constructor for each race.

    We'll have to perform a bunch of joins to get constructor results and names from 2010-2022.

    "Performance" here is quite ambiguous. Is is the final driver position? The
    number of points?  
    After a bit of inspection, `construction_standings` contains two things: the points accumulated until a specific race, and the accumulated wins. 

    Assume a team as the following results:
    ```
    race_id| points
    1      | 15
    2      | 6
    3      | 7
    ```
    They'll have the following standings:
    ```
    1      | 15
    2      | 21
    3      | 28
    ```


Home vs away's effect on performance. (Does having a race in your country affect performance?)
	Find a relation between the nationality of the driver and his performance in races that take place in his homeland(ex:: Lewis Hamilton performance in Silverstone track)
	Find a relation between the performance of the constructor and the race they compete in (ex: Ferrariâ€™s performance in Monza)

[Inferential] Given that Mercedes drivers have above average top speed, does this apply to all German teams?
